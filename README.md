# Peacock Strings

Adds Peacock's strings to the game without the use of dynamic resources.

**How to Update**

To update this mod, you can get the latest version of `h3_locale.json` from the `resources` folder in the
main [Peacock repository](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/Peacock) and replace `peacockstrings.locr.json`
with it (keeping the file name `peacockstrings.locr.json`) and changing the `hash` to
`[assembly:/localization/hitman6/conversations/ui/pro/online/peacock.sweetmenutext].pc_localized-textlist`.

**Installation Instructions**

1. Make sure the Simple Mod Framework is installed, you can find [it here](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/200/).
2. Download the zip from the Releases tab and open the Mod Manager GUI, use the **Add a Mod** button and select the zip you just downloaded.
3. Press **Apply** and enjoy your localised strings.
